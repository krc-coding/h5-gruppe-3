Shop Data Behandling

we want to create a system to collect data from physical shops
the data we are interested in collecting is
- how many people have entered the shop
- how many products have been sold
- what types of products
- the total value of products sold
- how many packetes have been collected from and delevered to the shop

the purpose of it is to collect data to make it easier for the shop to plan ahead knowing when people are most likely to enter and what products are sold most and when.
