**Get data from a specific device:**

if you want to get data from a specific device (normaly your own device) you will have to type in the UUID of the device before clicking search. 

(device UUID's are displayed on the device screen)

here are some device UUID's you can try:

- 63ea5a6f-506d-36e2-a711-3d96e1fc8b7b
